Automation can help reduce the number of crashes on our roads.
Government data identifies driver behavior or error as a factor in 94 percent of crashes, and self-driving vehicles can help reduce driver error.
Higher levels of autonomy have the potential to reduce risky and dangerous driver behaviors. The greatest promise may be reducing the devastation of impaired driving, drugged driving, unbelted vehicle occupants, speeding and distraction.

Greater Independence

Full automation offers more personal freedom.
People with disabilities, like the blind, are capable of self-sufficiency, and highly automated vehicles can help them live the life they want.
These vehicles can also enhance independence for seniors.
Ride-sharing of HAVs could reduce costs of personal transportation, providing more affordable mobility.

Saving Money
Automated driving systems could impact our pocketbooks in many ways.

HAVs can help avoid the costs of crashes, including medical bills, lost work time and vehicle repair. 
Fewer crashes may reduce the costs of insurance.

More Productivity

Wide-scale deployment of HAVs could allow drivers to recapture time.
In the future, HAVs could offer the convenience of dropping vehicle occupants at their destination, whether an airport or shopping mall, while the vehicle parks itself.
In a fully automated vehicle, all occupants could safely pursue more productive or entertaining activities, like responding to email or watching a movie.

"teju2.txt";"This is how Anthony Foxx, former U.S. secretary of transportation, envisioned the future of autonomous vehicles in 2016:

â€œBy 2021, we will see autonomous vehicles in operation across the country in ways that we [only] imagine today. â€¦ Families will be able to walk out of their homes and call a vehicle, and that vehicle will take them to work or to school. Weâ€™re going to see transit systems sharing services with some of these companies. Itâ€™s not just autonomy in the vehicles. Youâ€™re going to see trucks running more closely together, which results in fuel savings and positive climate impact. Youâ€™ll see companies that will start to use unmanned aircraft to deliver products to us. My daughter, who will be 16 in 2021, wonâ€™t have her driverâ€™s license. She will be using a service.â€

Fast forward to today, and Iâ€™m still driving a Peugeot 3008 â€” not a bad car by any means but miles away from Level 5 autonomy. Also, the self-driving-car hype has died down quite a bit, and the news from the industry doesnâ€™t exactly inspire optimism.

On May 6, Lyft LYFT, -1.54%, the ride-sharing service that competes with Uber UBER, -2.15%, sold its Level 5 division, an autonomous-vehicle unit, to Woven Planet, a Toyota TM, -0.90% subsidiary. After four years of research and development, the company seems to realize that autonomous driving is a tough nut to crack â€” much tougher than the team had anticipated.

Uber came to the same conclusion, but even earlier, in December. The company sold Advanced Technologies Group, its self-driving unit, to Aurora Innovation, citing high costs and more than 30 crashes, culminating in a fatality as the reason for cutting its losses.

Finally, several smaller companies, including Zoox, a robo-taxi company; Ike, an autonomous-trucking startup; and Voyage, a self-driving startup; have also passed the torch to companies with bigger budgets.


All this tells us two crucial things:

1. Those startups, like many in the industry, have underestimated the sheer difficulty of â€œleveling upâ€ vehicle autonomy to the fabled Level 5 (full driving automation, no human required). They were met with too many obstacles in research and testing, and had too little time to make significant breakthroughs. However, some got close!

2. The divisions sold, mentioned above, are worth millions, some even billions, of dollars. The companies making the acquisitions â€” giants like Amazon AMZN, +0.46%, GM GM, +0.51% and newcomer Nuro â€” understand the long-term value of attaining the holy grail of autonomous driving and are willing to pay the price for the know-how and R&D already competed by these hard-working trailblazers.

Limits of artificial intelligence
But why didnâ€™t things go down as planned?

The state-of-the-art semiautonomous cars of the present are as smart and responsive as their artificial-intelligence (AI) algorithms allow them to be. These deep-learning algorithms are trained on insane amounts of data, which helps them recognize an ever-growing number of traffic situations and act accordingly.

However, this method isnâ€™t foolproof. There is an unknown number of situations that AI has not been trained on that can potentially confuse or trick the computer, resulting in injury or death of passengers or pedestrians.

To that end, owners of self-driving cars should always keep their eyes on the road and be ready to act at a momentâ€™s notice. Every day, autonomous-vehicle systems are becoming more sophisticated, their algorithms more optimized â€” smarter, more robust and capable of handling a growing number of traffic scenarios.

However, no matter how much they improve, theoretically, there will always be a situation that an AI wonâ€™t be able to detect and react to. Unless the industry and public agree to accept a flawed self-driving system â€” one capable of failure â€” autonomous vehicles on our streets will never become mainstream. Achieving perfection here canâ€™t, and shouldnâ€™t, be the goal.

Airplanes are still much safer than cars, yet many people still fear flying and would much rather take their chances by driving a car. This irrational decision-making is rooted in the fear of the unknown and the unease we feel when we lose control, which inevitably happens with self-driving cars. It was hard enough to trust someone else to drive us around; it will be harder still to relinquish our safety and security to an algorithm.

Car-hacking
Speaking of which, things arenâ€™t perfect in that area either: In 2019, Regulus Cyber researchers found that spoofing attacks on the Tesla GNSS (GPS) receiver could easily be carried out wirelessly and remotely, exploiting security vulnerabilities in mission-critical telematics, sensor fusion and navigation capabilities. The remote attack caused one Tesla TSLA, +0.13% to abruptly slow down and unexpectedly make a sharp turn off a main road. Although its driver was attentive and switched to manual control, he was not able to stop the car from leaving the road.

Tesla reacted by patching the vulnerability and later used this case to highlight the necessity of constant vigilance for drivers relying on Teslaâ€™s Navigate on Autopilot feature. The incident is now more than two years old, but the topic of cybersecurity is as relevant as ever â€” as vehicles become open to external data streams, vulnerability to cyberattacks increases as well.

Is the convenience of autonomous driving really worth the risk of having your car hijacked remotely? Although this type of attack can be circumvented by relying on inertial measurement units (IMUs) and sensors that donâ€™t broadcast or download external data, attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in those systems could be used to the same detrimental effect.";"Nano";"teju2.txt-Nano"
"teju3.txt";"Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in a wide variety of products and services, including maps embedded on our smart phones and â€œchat botsâ€ that help answer our questions on websites. Many hope that AI will transform our economy in ways that drive growth, similar to how steam engines did in the late 19th century and electricity did in the early 20th century. But it is hard to imagine that maps on smart phones, chatbots, and other existing AI-enabled services will drive the type of economic growth we saw from stream and electricity. What we need to see are some dramatic new AI-enabled products and services that transform our way of lifeâ€”in short, we are waiting for an AI â€œkiller app.â€
Autonomous vehicles (AVs)â€”vehicles that accelerate, brake, and turn on their own, requiring little or no input from a human driverâ€”may be such a killer app that transforms our economy significantly. AI supports AVs in a variety of ways, including quickly processing and interpreting the large amounts of data generated by the vehicleâ€™s cameras and sensors and helping to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and safety. The impacts of broad adoption of AVs are equally numerous, from potentially lowering transportation costs by limiting the need for drivers to possibly transforming mobility in urban and suburban environments. While the relative timing and scale of economic growth is not yet clearâ€”and subject to some debate among scholarsâ€”a key step in maximizing the benefits of AVs is passing federal legislation, rather than relying on a patchwork of state and local guidelines. To inform the debate and help prepare policymakers for the task at hand, this report will examine the state of AVs, the potential for them to become a â€œkiller appâ€ with broad impacts, and the existing and potential regulations that could ensure net positive effects on the economy and society as a whole.

THE CURRENT STATE AND FUTURE OF AVS
The current standards for autonomous driving were developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International). According to the SAE standard, the automation capability of vehicles ranges from Level 0, with no autonomy, to Level 5, which is full automation. Level 1 features include park assist, lane assist and adaptive cruise control. Some Level 3 vehicles, which include full self-driving capabilities but require human intervention in complex situations such as traffic jams, may be commercially available in 2021. No Level 4 or 5 cars, which would not require any human intervention, are yet certified for use on regular roads, though there are some such as Googleâ€™s Waymo that are in development.

While the potential impacts of AVs are substantial, it will take time for them to be realized; AVs are still some years from being commercially available, let alone in widespread use. To give a reasonable sense of timing, Chris Urmsonâ€”a DARPA challenge winner, head of Googleâ€™s Waymo autonomous vehicle unit for many years, and now CEO of a self-driving vehicle software company named Aurora â€”argues it may take up to 30 to 50 years before widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Despite predictions to the contraryâ€”e.g., Elon Muskâ€™s 2019 prediction that there would be a Tesla driverless taxi fleet in some regions by 2020â€”time frames of this magnitude are common in the automobile industry. Choe, Oettl and Seamans (2021) report that widespread adoption of new innovations in the automobile sector historically can take several decades.[1] There are a number of factors that contribute to technology adoption, and even if a new technology is feasible, it may not be available at a price point that many consumers will pay. For example, turbo-charged engines, which help to reduce the amount of fuel needed, did not start to become popular until oil prices started to rise in the 1970s.

In short, the timing of adoption of AVs and the economic impacts that will follow depend on many factors. For regulators and policymakers interested in shaping what will likely be considerable economic and societal impacts of AVs, now is the time.
EFFECT ON OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
Supporters of autonomous vehicles argue that they may provide a variety of benefits including fuel efficiency and safety. Indeed, the Brookings Institution recently published a book on the topic (Winston and Karpilow, 2020).[2] The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) argues that AVs are more fuel efficient than human-driven cars, which means fewer emissions. However, AVs may increase vehicle traffic, potentially nullifying emissions reduction from fuel efficiency. Kroger, Kuhnimhof, and Trommer (2019) project the adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies may increase vehicle traffic by 2-9 percent as a result of new automobile user groups as well as lower generalized costs of car travel.[3]

AVs will likely be safer than human-driven cars, in large part through reducing human error which the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) estimates accounts for 94 percent of crashes. While widespread adoption of AVs should ultimately result in safer roads, there have been several high profile accidents involving AVs, such as a Waymo van that crashed into a car in Arizona. Perhaps as a result of some of these high-profile accidents, consumer demand for AVs seems to be relatively low. According to a 2021 survey by the American Automobile Association, only 14 percent of drivers report that they would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself, a response similar to the 2020 survey. It is possible, however, that consumer attitudes will change once Level 4 and 5 vehicles become commercially available.

AVs may help to reduce labor input costs in driving-intensive industries. However, as Gittleman and Monaco (2017) point out, there are several types of drivers, and autonomous driving will likely affect some types more than others.[4]  Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be used for heavy and tractor trailer truck purposes (aka â€œlong haulâ€) than local delivery given the relative ease of navigating on highways and all the other tasks associated with local delivery, including freight handling, paperwork, and customer service. Gittleman and Monaco estimate that Level 4 and 5 automation may ultimately displace 300,000 to 400,000 drivers. But the authors highlight that there are many practical limitations to automation. For example, they highlight that one of the important functions of a truck driver is to serve as a security guard for the freight.
A recent paper by Gelauff, Ossokina, and Teulings (2019) envisions some of the longer-term outcomes from AVs.[5]  The authors model two countervailing effects from AVs, each of which lead to differing outcomes on population distribution. On one hand, AVs may lead to improved use of time during car trips, which lowers the cost of living at a distance from cities. On the other hand, AVs may lead to improved public transit options in urban environments in the form of shared-ride autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The authors argue that SAVs may be more efficient than existing public transit and may make city living relatively more attractive leading to more population clustering in cities. The authors argue that the second effect may outweigh the first and ultimately may lead to overall population shifts towards large, attractive cities at the expense of smaller urban and non-urban areas. While the authors donâ€™t speculate on the ultimate economic effects of such a change, it is worth noting that literature from economic geography suggests that there are many agglomeration effects from living in or close to cities, including greater economic growth and innovation.[6]  It is also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large shift in population away from many urban environments, at least in the short run.

In short, AVs will likely affect our economy and society in a variety of ways. AVs may lead to fewer emissions and increased safety. By decreasing the need for humans to drive, AVs will likely transform the type of work done by humans in the transportation sector of the economy and may also change the way that humans commute to and from work. How all this plays out, however, depends on numerous factors including, importantly, existing and future regulations.

CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE AV LEGISLATION
The National Conference of State Legislatures highlights that a number of states have introduced and enacted laws related to autonomous vehicles. Notably, in December 2020, California State Senator Ben Allen introduced a bill to establish a new Council on the Future of Transportation in California that would promote state legislation for autonomous vehicles, in addition to other transportation-related policy. Also, in November 2020 the California Public Utilities Commission approved autonomous vehicle regulatory framework that would make it easier for companies to provide autonomous vehicle transportation services to the public. While these laws indicate that state legislators are responsive to local concerns about autonomous vehicles, the risk is a resulting patchwork of state laws.

With this concern in mind, there have been attempts at federal legislation, notably in 2017 with the SELF DRIVE Act in the House and the AV START Act in the Senate. The SELF DRIVE Act (Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act) was passed in the House in 2017 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would have provided NHTSA with the authority to regulate AVs. NHTSA would be authorized to require safety assessment certifications and states would be preempted from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of AVs unless those laws enact standards identical to federal standards. In addition, the bill would have required that manufacturers of AVs develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. The AV START Act (American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act) was introduced in the Senate in 2017 but did not advance. Like the SELF DRIVE Act, it would have established a framework for a federal role in oversight of AVs, preempting state laws and providing clarity to stakeholders including car manufacturers and insurance companies.";"Porsche";"teju3.txt-Porsche"
